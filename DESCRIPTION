Description: The following package allows the user to build various Bayesian 
  occupancy models. At present the standard occupancy model as well a restricted 
  spatial models can be undertaken. We specifically assume that the regression 
  effects all use logit link functions. Gibbs sampling algorithms are developed 
  to undertake all MCMC sampling.
