Description: The following package allows the user to build various Bayesian 
  occupancy models. At present the standard occupancy models and restricted 
  spatial occupancy models can be undertaken. We specifically assume that the regression 
  effects all use logit link functions. Gibbs sampling algorithms are developed 
  to undertake all MCMC sampling.
