\title{vb_ReqDesigns - An internal function that checks the formula call.}

\description{
The function makes a call to 'vb_Designs_check' and checks that the names included in the formula call is the same as those included in the design matrices. It then also constructs 'W' and 'X' as used by the various functions that does the MCMC sampling.
}

\usage{
vb_ReqDesigns(formula, design_mats)
}
\arguments{
  \item{formula }{ - Double right-hand side formula describing covariates of occupancy and detection in that order.}
  \item{design_mats }{ - A named list generated by the call vb_Designs(W, X, y).}
